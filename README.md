# AdminlteTheme

A gem that simplifies your adminLTE setup on ruby on rails.

## Installation

Add these to your gemfile

```ruby
gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'bootstrap-sass'
gem "font-awesome-rails"
gem 'adminlte_theme'
```
I didn't include those gem as dependencies to allow you to customize and manage your gems

Add this to your ```application.js```
```js
//= require jquery
//= require bootstrap-sprockets
//= require adminlte
```

Then in your ```application.css.scss```
```scss
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";
@import 'font-awesome';
@import "AdminLTE";
@import "AdminLTE/skins/skin-green";
```

### HTMLs
